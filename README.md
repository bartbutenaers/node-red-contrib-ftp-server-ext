# node-red-contrib-ftp-server-ext
A Node-RED node that allows to run an embedded FTP server inside Node-RED.

I would like to thank the folks from QuorumDMS for their support for [ftp-srv](https://github.com/QuorumDMS/ftp-srv), and for kindly reviewing all my pull requests.

## Install
Run the following npm command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):
```
npm install node-red-contrib-ftp-server-ext
```

## Support my Node-RED developments
Please buy my wife a coffee to keep her happy, while I am busy developing Node-RED stuff for you ...
